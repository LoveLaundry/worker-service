"""Sri Lankan time — the only calendar this business runs on.

Love Laundry operates only in Sri Lanka, so every *business day* boundary,
"today", and month bucket is Asia/Colombo. That is a fixed UTC+05:30 offset
with no daylight saving, which is why this is a ``timedelta`` rather than a
``ZoneInfo``: it needs no tzdata package, and it behaves identically in a slim
container, on Vercel (which defaults to UTC) and on a developer's laptop.

Storage stays UTC — ``datetime.now(UTC)`` is still correct for stamping rows.
Only the *derivation of a calendar day from an instant* is timezone-sensitive,
and that is what lives here.

Do not use this module for JWT ``exp`` claims or HMAC replay windows: those are
wire-level instants that must stay UTC.
